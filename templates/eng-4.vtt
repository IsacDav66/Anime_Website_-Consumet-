00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.620
Now, for Earth...

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.620
Take that!

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.420
You bastard!

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.440
Who do you think you are?!

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.120
Why, you bast...

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.160
Spare me!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.870
As long as there is
evil in the world...

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.880
the light ofjustice
will burn as a flame.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.880
Great Saiyaman, Mark I...

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.710
and Mark II...

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.970
whoosh to the scene again!

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.390
<i>Nailed it!</i>

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.900
I'm back now. Nice work.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.740
Sorry I took so long. The
bathroom was packed.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.330
Gohan, we know who you are...

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.290
All right, let's continue.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.880
Here, the writer, Doskevich, leaves
the girls he was in love with.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.300
Yes, this is Great
Saiyaman, Mark ll.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.880
A strange old man has climbed Raenzel
Tower, and is causing a disturbance.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.930
You can handle something
like that on your own!

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.100
Geez...

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.100
Sensei, excuse me, I need
to use the bathroom.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.890
Again?

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.900
I think the frog I ate
yesterday might have been bad.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.320
Just leave me alone!

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.320
My hopes and dreams
are all gone!

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.110
I'm going to jump from
here to my death!

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.080
Hey, that's the old guy that was carrying
on about some music box on TV earlier.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.080
Yeah.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.500
It's that strange old man, huh?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.920
Oh, it's the Great Saiyaman!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.080
Saiyaman!

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.500
Saiyaman!

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.300
We're counting on you!

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.510
Whoever may come up here,
I'm not coming down!

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.510
Old timer, it's dangerous up here!
Come on down with us!

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.890
Go away! I want to die!

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.310
Then why don't you go ahead?

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.520
Videl-san!

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.100
Come on, hurry up and jump!

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.400
All right, watch this!

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.530
Y- You're kidding!

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.110
Save me!

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.320
He did it!

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.120
Are you all right?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.080
Couldn't you have saved me sooner?!
What if I had died?!

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.080
Strange old man...

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.090
You don't know about
the hero Tapion?

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.920
No.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.090
How unfortunate.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.090
Imagine, not knowing about
the legendary hero,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.300
who saved Planet Conuts in the Southern
Galaxy a thousand years ago...

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.890
Gohan-kun, we have
to get back soon.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.520
I sure would like to meet him.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.890
Wouldn't you, though?
Can I meet him?

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.110
I'd like to let you
meet him, but I can't.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.530
Unfortunately, the
hero Tapion...

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.110
is sealed up inside this
mysterious music box.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.120
Inside there? If he's
a hero, then why...?

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.080
Once the hero is revived, you
will understand everything.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.500
Gohan-kun, let's
hurry and get back.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.910
Just a moment.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.290
Old timer, what do you mean?

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.090
According to my sharp instincts, there
is a crisis closing in on the Earth!

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.090
A crisis on Earth?!

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.930
An enormous evil, one that will destroy
the universe, is approaching Earth.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.520
That is why we need the power
of the hero, Tapion, right now!

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.530
For that reason, I have spent thirty
years searching for this music box.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.530
Then you could just hurry up
and revive him, couldn't you?

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.740
I would do that, if I could!

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.950
You can't do it?

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.910
Can you turn this?

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.910
This?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.500
If you can get the music box to play,
the hero Tapion will be revived.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.290
Oh yeah? Why didn't
you say so sooner?

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.220
It won't move...

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.100
W- Why won't it?

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.020
Let me see that a minute.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.520
This thing is rusted.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.520
Miss! How could you do that?!

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.530
Let's go. Class is going to end.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.530
Oh, Videl-san!

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.110
Shen Long!

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.530
Please introduce
me to Shen Long.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.950
Shen Long?

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.500
Please have Shen Long revive
the hero Tapion! I beg you!

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.080
Old timer, how do you...?

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.460
I discovered that you people
have had dealings with Shen Long

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.920
during my investigations.
Please...

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.920
This is my lifelong wish...!

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.090
Then, that commotion earlier was
just an act to call us out?

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.760
You found me out, huh?

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.520
Gramps, you wouldn't be telling
us a fish story, right?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.100
Yeah, don't you think so, too?

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.940
Miss, are you still saying that?

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.110
There isn't a moment to lose. If we
don't hurry and revive the hero Tapion,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.530
Earth is going to be destroyed.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.540
It's no use. I can't
trace out what's inside.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.790
It looks like it's made of
some kind of special material.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.920
Yow. I can't do it.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.930
If not even Goku can handle it, then
I guess it's not completely bogus.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.100
Is this guy strong?

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.520
Of course. He is a
hero, after all.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.520
Is that so? All right...

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.520
What do you say we look
for the Dragonballs?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.940
Right.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.530
This is a real godsend for me,
to find you here on Earth...

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.120
Huh? Old timer, you mean
you ain't from Earth?

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.370
T- T-That was just a
figure of speech.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.080
All right, Goten! Let's
hurry and find them!

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.550
Mm-hmm! I want to hurry
and meet this hero!

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:58.100
Say, if his story is true, what do
you think this hero Tapion is like?

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:58.970
Beats me.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.770
I'm so interested in heroes!

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.360
Sure enough, I'm all by myself.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.750
Here it is!

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.760
All right! I found
the YiXing Qiu ball!

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.520
Ah, there it is, there it is!

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.520
So, how are you going
to retrieve it?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.940
Like this!

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.910
See?

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.540
All right, we should
have them all now.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.920
Come forth, Shen Long!

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.110
M- Marvelous! This is...

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.940
Shen Long?

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.950
I shall grant thee any wish.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.530
Now, speak forth thy wish.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.500
L- I'd like you to remove the
seal on the hero Tapion...

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.920
That is a simple matter.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.340
I have granted thy wish.
Farewell.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.110
H- Hold on, what is this?

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.360
Nothing changed, did it?

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.550
It's turning!

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.910
So it is true, huh?

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.080
That's a pretty melody.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.090
There's something a bit
sad about it, though.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.920
Here he comes, here he comes!

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.760
He's here!

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.580
Father...

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.570
That's an incredible <i>Ki...</i>

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.490
So what the old timer said...

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.740
was true.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.140
Awesome!

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.330
Isn't he a fine young man?

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.510
Stay back!

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.090
Cool!

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.510
Are you the one who revived me?

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.100
It must have been hard to spend those
thousands of years in such a tight place.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.100
Who asked you to?! Put me back!

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:17.940
That's impossible now. The
music box has been destroyed.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.910
Now, now, you've finally been let
out, so let's try to get along...

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.500
Please do not come near me.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.500
You people have done
a terrible thing!

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.920
A terrible thing?

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.090
I want to be like him!

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.930
What are you talking about?

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.930
Any boy who can't even say a word of
thanks after we revived him is awful.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.520
Wait up! Ah, Trunks!

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.100
No! Come back here!

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.940
Any impressions?

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.980
He reeks of danger, huh?

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.360
I don't know...

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.510
Trunks-kun, we'd better not.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.930
What are you talking about?
He's a hero!

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.550
Don't you want to hear
all of his stories?

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.930
But he said not
to come near him.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.560
Yeah, but...

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.770
What's wrong?

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.530
That's a hero for you!

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.950
He's awfully intense.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.920
Huh? Where did
that old timer go?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.080
Now that you mention it...

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.920
He's probably gone off to flirt
with some pichi-pichi gal!

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.090
He's not like a certain dirty
old man I could mention.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.760
If not a pichi-pichi gal,
perhaps it's some older woman.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:26.950
Yoink!

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.080
Huh? They're all gone...

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.540
Huh? Ah, here's
one, here's one...

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.510
Um, Big Brother,

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.760
we'll just leave this
meat here for you.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.770
U- Um, Mama's seasoning
is pretty good.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.520
Well, we're going home now.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.070
I'll be back tomorrow, okay?

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.990
Hey, what are you doing?!
Hurry and get going!

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.740
What was that?

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.920
What them?

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.760
This is awful!

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.940
It's the Saiyamen! The
Great Saiyamen have come!

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.360
All right, let's let
them take care of this.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.570
What is that thing?!

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.130
What is that thing?!

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.300
What is that?!

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.520
A ghost with legs? No, it's
a monster with just legs!

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.560
This could be the enormous evil
that the old man was talking about.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.940
That has to be it! Gohan-kun,
let's do our usual!

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.520
Eh? You want to do that?!

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.940
Isn't it obvious?

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:35.490
As long as the Great Saiyamen are here,
evil shall not prosper in our world!

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.700
Great Saiyaman Mark I...

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.870
and Mark II...

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.750
as you expected...

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.130
Hear us out until
we've finished!

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.930
Damn it...!

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.350
Wreck the city, will you?!
You'll pay for this!

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.560
Here goes!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.950
What kind of beast is this?!

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.950
All right...!

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.750
Huh?

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.100
Gohan-kun, let him have it!

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.940
I get it! He becomes solid
momentarily when he attacks!

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.020
All right...!

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.770
You got him!

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.770
No, not yet.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.950
That melody...

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.130
The monster disappeared!

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600
Tapion...

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.350
Gohan-kun, over there!

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.520
B- Big Brother, if you
want, you can use this.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.930
Don't come near me!

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.520
Don't get mad, I'm leaving.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.110
Oh, you didn't eat?

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.530
Get lost!

00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:59.940
R" Right!

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.770
Oh, no!

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.550
W- What?! What happened?!

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.560
Thank goodness! You're safe!

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.110
I know.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.940
I'll leave your
breakfast here, okay?

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.530
Bye. I'll bring you more later.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.910
Apparently, Trunks-kun has
been sneaking food to him.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.500
Oh, yeah? That's nice
of Trunks-kun to do.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.090
He's always talking about how jealous he is
of Goten-kun for having an older brother,

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.920
so maybe he feels like he's
got his own big brother now.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.890
I know how Trunks-kun feels. I'm
an only child, too, after all.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.100
But you've been so
keyed up lately.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.350
It's Trunks-kun's power
that is keyed up!

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.490
No! No!

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.120
That's Big Brother's!
You can't eat it!

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.920
Aw, geez...

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.130
Okay, Big Brother, I'll leave
tonight's stuff here, okay?

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.090
That flute sounds nice.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.760
Play it some more.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.350
Then again, never mind.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.540
Boy, give me the flute!

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.920
Trunks, the flute!

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.090
“R" Right! __Wait.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:50.760
Tapion is no hero! He is the very
monster that ran wild through the city!

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.100
Trunks, don't let him fool you.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.100
If you give him the flute,
then the whole earth,

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.520
to say nothing of the universe,
will be completely destroyed!

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.110
Now, hand it over to me.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.770
Trunks, trust me.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:10.780
Come on...

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:29.920
That's it, hurry and
give me the flute.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.930
Big Brother!

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.770
W- What?!

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.940
Big Brother!

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.530
I know... I'm going...

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.910
I sure am hungry.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.920
Would you eat with me?

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.550
This is really delicious!
Try some!

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.510
Trunks brought his big brother
over to spend the night.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.930
Isn't that amazing? I mean,
becoming friends with a hero...

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.930
He is absolutely delighted.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.530
See? See? See? This is awesome!

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.070
They bought it for me for my
birthday last year. Look!

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:42.910
Well? Isn't this fun? And look, when
you do this here, it does this!

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.910
Say, Big Brother, you try it.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.960
And actually, after
that, you know what?

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:55.930
Say, Big Brother, do
you have any brothers?

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.090
Yeah, one younger brother.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.310
Wow, that's great! What
kind of boy is he?

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.520
He was a kind boy,
like you, Trunks.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.940
Say, tell me about your
planet, Big Brother.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.520
Sure.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:15.070
My home is a place called Planet
Conuts, in the Southern Galaxy.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:21.080
It was a beautiful planet, which, like Earth
here, was blessed with greenery and water.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.910
But then, one day, there was a
warlock who raised this phantasm...

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.090
named Hildegarn,
which attacked us.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:35.920
People were killed, and cities
were demolished and destroyed.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.520
Just as everyone had
resigned themselves to die,

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.350
a miracle happened.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.500
Minoshia...

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.340
<i>you've been killed, huh?</i>

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.550
<i>Take care, Trunks.</i>

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.980
Where are you going?

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.900
If you'd like, you're welcome
to stay with us from now on.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.120
Please, feel free. Trunks
would be thrilled, after all.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.080
I can't do that.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.750
Why not?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.090
There is a phantasm locked
away inside my body.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.510
Huh? A phantasm?

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.760
I'm afraid I don't know what you're
talking about. Explain it to me.

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:07.520
What is this "phantasm"?

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.100
Right...

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.350
There was a sect of Warlocks that
drifted in from somewhere...

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:21.490
They took the spirit body of the totem that had
absorbed all of the evil will on Planet Conuts,

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.530
infused it with wicked energy,

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.750
and transformed it into
the phantasm Hildegarn.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:47.510
Those Warlocks must have had
incredible demonic powers, huh?

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.930
Yes. Hoi was one of their order.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.100
Then we were all completely
taken in by that old man.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.940
But why is the phantasm
within your body?

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:04.910
It's because there was a legendary sword
and flute that could control the totem.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.910
By any chance, do
you mean those?

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.330
Yes.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.750
These items were
given to us by God.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.500
While we suppressed the
phantasm's power with the flute,

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:24.090
a priest who was in the service of
God split the phantasm's body...

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.760
into an upper half
and a lower half.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.500
And then, Hildegarn's upper
half was locked inside my body,

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.960
and the lower half was locked
inside my brother's body.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.340
Peace returned to Planet Conuts.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:14.100
As a result, my brother and
I were hailed as heroes.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.940
But you were inside
that music box, right?

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:25.900
The Warlocks tried to retake the phantasm,
and began coming after us. And so...

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.910
to lock away the
phantasm forever,

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.910
we had ourselves sealed up
inside those music boxes.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.500
However, with the two
of us near each other,

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:46.510
the upper half and the lower half resonated
with each other, trying to reunite.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.090
In order to keep the phantasm
from ever being revived,

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.510
the two of us were each sent away
in pods to different galaxies.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.940
However, Hoi wants to make
the whole universe his own,

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.940
so he located both
of our music boxes.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.110
Where is your brother?

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.070
He has probably been
killed already.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:08.070
We can't let Hoi get
away with this.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.910
As long as I keep his
upper half locked away,

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.910
Hildegarn cannot be revived
in his complete form.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.910
You mean, you haven't slept in all
these days since you were released?

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.910
N- No.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.080
All right, let me
take care of this.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.500
All I have to do is make
something like that music box,

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.920
to keep that power
under control, right?

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.510
C- Can you do that?

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:34.100
I haven't thrown out the broken
music box yet, so I think I can.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.930
Please make it, I beg you!

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.940
You got it. Hang in
there until then, okay?

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.020
Yes.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.940
There you go!

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:51.910
It's all done!

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.910
Tapion's bedroom!

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.990
Really?!

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.920
Inside here should be just like the
music box. Go on inside and see.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.760
You can go in there and sleep
without having to worry.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.760
Thank you very much!

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:41.910
Once Hildegarn is reunited,
this will be nothing!

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.130
I will hold the whole universe
in my hand, starting with Earth!

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:14.740
What?!

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:28.130
Is that right? So that's
what the story is, huh?

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.930
Big Brother!

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:39.930
What happened to you?

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.100
Where's Hildegarn?

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.940
I somehow managed to lock his
upper half inside my body,

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.940
but his lower half is
running loose in the city!

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:49.940
What?!

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.490
The power attracting his upper half and
lower half together has gotten stronger,

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:57.070
and there's nothing
more that I can do!

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.910
Big Brother!

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.080
I can make something
even sturdier!

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.910
It's too late now!

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.340
N- Now, while you still can, please, you
have to kill me, and Hildegarn with me!

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.920
Big Brother!

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:21.560
Now! Hurry! I won't
let you do that!

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:39.490
Trunks!

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:41.080
Big Brother, play it!

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.740
All right!

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.920
Big Brother!

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.510
His body...!

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:39.970
It's reunited!

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.930
After a millennium's
worth of time,

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:49.100
the phantasm Hildegarn has
now been completely revived!

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:55.360
Now, suck dry as much energy
from the Earthlings as you like!

00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.990
Damn it!

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:24.930
Big Brother!

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.520
That thing won't do
you any more good!

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.930
Impossible!

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.980
Behold, the power of the
completely restored Hildegarn!

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.530
You'll have to face me!

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:44.910
Huh?

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.910
Father!

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.080
Leave it to us from
here on, okay?

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.920
Big Brother, don't
you move from here.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.960
Trunks!

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.140
We ain't letting
you have your way!

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.360
His power and speed have
risen to a whole new level!

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.910
Father!

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.760
I can't get a bead
on his solid form!

00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:00.070
Smash up another man's
house, will you?!

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.900
I am in a foul mood today!

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:06.910
Don't come too close,
or you'll get burned!

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.740
Dammit!

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.920
I was too easy... on him...

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:05.920
Vegeta!

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.930
Papa! Father!

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.980
Goten, Fusion!

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.960
All right...!

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.490
Fu... sion!

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:27.900
<i>Ha!</i>

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:33.910
Yay! Super Saiyan 3,
right out of the gate!

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.710
Yo, yo, monster!
You're finished now!

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.970
Gotenks-sama is going to send
you off to Yama-sama's place!

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.900
<i>Now! Continuous
Die-Die Missiles!</i>

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.920
Hm? Finished already? Aw,
that was disappointing.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.090
What are you doing?! Hurry
and finish him off!

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.550
Okay, okay...

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.750
I- It can't be...!

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:07.750
You're kidding!

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.350
Goten! Trunks!

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.940
Gohan-kun!

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.920
Videl-san...

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.100
What incredible power!
He really is a monster!

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.770
Dammit!

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:16.740
Oh, crap!

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:36.760
All of our attacks are
going right though him!

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:50.900
Damn... No matter how
much power we have...

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.530
it's no use against him...

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:03.490
Destroy the entire universe!

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:07.960
It will all become power
for you, Hildegarn!

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.350
If this is a bad
dream, then wake up...

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.730
Big Brother...!

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:46.750
You fool! You think that thing
is going to work at this point?!

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:54.920
What?!

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.520
A hero...

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.560
Big Brother is a
hero, all right!

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.980
<i>I cannot allow this planet to get
caught in the middle of this, too.</i>

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:23.740
<i>How much longer will you feed on the suffering
of others like this, until you've had enough?</i>

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.910
Impossible!

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:39.510
You did it!

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.380
You did it, Big Brother!

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.930
Trunks...

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:51.770
Kill me, and Hildegarn with me!

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.480
You have to protect Earth!

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.900
L- I can't do that!

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:59.320
Kill me! You want to be
a hero too, don't you?!

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.490
L- I can't!

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:07.490
Trunks, if this keeps up,
Earth will be destroyed.

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:11.910
Please, let me die as a hero!

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.920
If he is revived one more time,
there will be no stopping him.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.340
Please!

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:36.770
Thank you. I'm glad
to have met you.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.740
S- Stop!

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.540
Big Brother!

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:14.350
Fool! You do not have the power to
contain Hildegarn in his complete form!

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:30.530
Get them!

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.930
There ain't no way you're
going to get away with this!

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:20.130
Trunks, stay out of this!
I'm going to defeat him!

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:24.090
Father! His weakness is...!

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:26.510
I know!

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:30.930
I can only beat him during the instant
he becomes solid as he attacks!

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.930
That won't work.

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:42.360
This sort of punch won't work!
Fight like you mean it!

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:48.900
Hey, what's the matter?
Come and get me!

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.120
If I don't do it...

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:03.710
If I don't do it...

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.550
If I don't do it...

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:10.930
who will?!

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.940
<i>Ryu-ken!</i>

00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:59.560
You did it!

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:15.910
It's my fault that so many
people were made to die.

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:19.910
If only I had been able to
fully control Hildegarn...

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.920
Don't worry. We'll ask Shen Long to bring
those who were killed back to life.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.510
There. Now you should be able to go
back a thousand years, to your time.

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:34.510
T- Thanks.

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:38.560
Aww, and here I had finally
gotten a Big Brother.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.500
As long as we have the time
machine, you can see him again.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.930
Oh, that's right!

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.020
Trunks!

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.900
You're giving it to me?

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:52.490
Yeah. I don't need it
anymore, after all.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:55.910
All right! Yay! Yay! How nice!

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:58.320
Okay then, everyone, take care!

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:16.930
<i>This blue world</i>

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:25.010
now shines, embraced in love.

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.900
<i>I wouldn't lie to you!</i>

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:40.980
<i>I</i> won't <i>stand by</i> and <i>let anyone destroy
the earth, where dreams dance!</i>

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:48.330
With a bang-up
passion, Dragonball!

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:54.510
<i>When I throw a punch,</i>

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:57.930
<i>he disappears like smoke.</i>

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:03.930
<i>My foe this time has
me bowled over.</i>

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.890
<i>(Go!) Don't let your guard down!</i>

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.900
<i>(Jump!) Gohan and Videl!</i>

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.070
<i>(Go!) Even if your friends...</i>

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:16.070
<i>(Kick!) ...get taken down,</i>

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:24.150
<i>in the end, if! Don't
do it, who will?!</i>

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.080
<i>I wouldn't lie to you!</i>

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:30.920
I'm through playing around!

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.500
<i>I'm going to show you</i>

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:37.510
my Super Saiyan power!

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:42.930
With a knock-down-drag-out
fight, Dragonball!
