WEBVTT

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.650
Now, for Earth...

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.620
Take that!

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.490
You bastard!

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.520
Who do you think you are?!

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.060
Why, you bast...

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.230
Spare me!

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.070
As long as there is evil in the world...

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.070
...the light of justice will burn as a flame.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.080
Great Saiyaman, Mark I...

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.740
...and Mark II...

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.910
...whoosh to the scene again!

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.440
Nailed it!

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.860
- I'm back now.
- Nice work.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.770
Sorry I took so long.
The bathroom was packed.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.440
Gohan, we know who you are...

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.410
All right, let's continue.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.120
Here, the writer, Doskevich,
leaves the girls he was in love with.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.450
Yes, this is Great Saiyaman, Mark II.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.120
A strange old man has climbed Raenzel Tower,
and is causing a disturbance.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.890
You can handle something
like that on your own!

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.230
Geez...

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.230
Sensei, excuse me,
I need to use the bathroom.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.060
Again?

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.070
I think the frog I ate
yesterday might have been bad.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.410
Just leave me alone!

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.410
My hopes and dreams are all gone!

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.250
I'm going to jump from here to my death!

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.250
Hey, that's the old guy that was carrying
on about some music box on TV earlier.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.250
Yeah.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.590
It's that strange old man, huh?

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.920
Oh, it's the Great Saiyaman!

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.590
Saiyaman!

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.430
We're counting on you!

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.600
Whoever may come up here,
I'm not coming down!

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.600
Old timer, it's dangerous up here!
Come on down with us!

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.100
Go away! I want to die!

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.440
Then why don't you go ahead?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.610
Videl-san!

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.280
Come on, hurry up and jump!

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.470
All right, watch this!

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.580
Y- You're kidding!

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.220
Save me!

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.390
He did it!

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.220
Are you all right?

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.230
Couldn't you have saved me sooner?!
What if I had died?!

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.990
Strange old man...

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.230
You don't know about the hero Tapion?

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.900
No.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.240
How unfortunate.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.240
Imagine, not knowing
about the legendary hero,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.410
who saved Planet Conuts in the
Southern Galaxy a thousand years ago...

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.080
Gohan-kun, we have to get back soon.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.580
I sure would like to meet him.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.080
- Wouldn't you, though?
- Can I meet him?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.250
I'd like to let you meet him, but I can't.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.590
Unfortunately, the hero Tapion...

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.260
...is sealed up inside
this mysterious music box.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
Inside there? If he's a hero, then why...?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.270
Once the hero is revived, you
will understand everything.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.600
Gohan-kun, let's hurry and get back.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.940
Just a moment.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.440
Old timer, what do you mean?

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.210
According to my sharp instincts,
there is a crisis closing in on the Earth!

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.210
A crisis on Earth?!

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.890
An enormous evil, one that will destroy
the universe, is approaching Earth.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.520
That is why we need the power
of the hero, Tapion, right now!

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.560
For that reason, I have spent thirty
years searching for this music box.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.570
Then you could just hurry up
and revive him, couldn't you?

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.740
I would do that, if I could!

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.910
You can't do it?

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.910
Can you turn this?

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.910
This?

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.580
If you can get the music box to play,
the hero Tapion will be revived.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.380
Oh yeah? Why didn't you say so sooner?

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.320
It won't move...

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
W- Why won't it?

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.160
Let me see that a minute.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.600
This thing is rusted.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.540
Miss! How could you do that?!

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.540
Let's go. Class is going to end.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.540
Oh, Videl-san!

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.210
Shen Long!

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.550
Please introduce me to Shen Long.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.880
Shen Long?

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.550
Please have Shen Long revive
the hero Tapion! I beg you!

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.220
Old timer, how do you...?

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.520
I discovered that you people
have had dealings with Shen Long

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.890
during my investigations. Please...

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.900
This is my lifelong wish...!

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.230
Then, that commotion earlier
was just an act to call us out?

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.720
You found me out, huh?

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.570
Gramps, you wouldn't be
telling us a fish story, right?

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.240
Yeah, don't you think so, too?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.910
Miss, are you still saying that?

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.250
There isn't a moment to lose. If we
don't hurry and revive the hero Tapion,

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.590
Earth is going to be destroyed.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.620
It's no use. I can't
trace out what's inside.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.790
It looks like it's made of
some kind of special material.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.870
Yow. I can't do it.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.880
If not even Goku can handle it,
then I guess it's not completely bogus.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.210
Is this guy strong?

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.550
Of course. He is a hero, after all.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.550
Is that so? All right...

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.550
What do you say we look for the Dragon Balls?

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.040
Right.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.560
This is a real godsend for me,
to find you here on Earth...

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.230
Huh? Old timer, you mean you ain't from Earth?

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.390
T- T- That was just a figure of speech.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.240
All right, Goten! Let's hurry and find them!

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.570
Mm-hmm! I want to hurry and meet this hero!

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:59.250
Say, if his story is true, what do
you think this hero Tapion is like?

00:07:59.250 --> 00:07:59.920
Beats me.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.690
I'm so interested in heroes!

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.350
Sure enough, I'm all by myself.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.700
Here it is!

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.710
All right! I found the Yi Xing Qiu ball!

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.570
Ah, there it is, there it is!

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.570
So, how are you going to retrieve it?

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.060
Like this!

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.010
See?

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.520
All right, we should have them all now.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.020
Come forth, Shen Long!

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.210
M- Marvelous! This is...

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.880
...Shen Long?

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.880
I shall grant thee any wish.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.550
Now, speak forth thy wish.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.560
I- I'd like you to remove the
seal on the hero Tapion...

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.050
That is a simple matter.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.400
I have granted thy wish. Farewell.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.260
H- Hold on, what is this?

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.420
Nothing changed, did it?

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.600
It's turning!

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.090
So it is true, huh?

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.270
That's a pretty melody.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.280
There's something a bit sad about it, though.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.110
Here he comes, here he comes!

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.780
He's here!

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.630
Father...

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.620
That's an incredible Ki...

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.610
So what the old timer said...

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.780
...was true.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.290
Awesome!

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.450
Isn't he a fine young man?

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.560
Stay back!

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.230
Cool!

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.570
Are you the one who revived me?

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:10.240
It must have been hard to spend those
thousands of years in such a tight place.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.240
Who asked you to?! Put me back!

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:19.080
That's impossible now.
The music box has been destroyed.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.920
Now, now, you've finally been
let out, so let's try to get along...

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.590
Please do not come near me.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.600
You people have done a terrible thing!

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.090
A terrible thing?

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.270
I want to be like him!

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.940
What are you talking about?

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.950
Any boy who can't even say a word of
thanks after we revived him is awful.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.610
- Wait up!
- Ah, Trunks!

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.280
No! Come back here!

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.950
Any impressions?

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.940
He reeks of danger, huh?

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.380
I don't know...

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.580
Trunks-kun, we'd better not.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.920
What are you talking about? He's a hero!

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.580
Don't you want to hear all of his stories?

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.920
But he said not to come near him.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.580
Yeah, but...

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.760
What's wrong?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.600
That's a hero for you!

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.090
He's awfully intense.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.950
Huh? Where did that old timer go?

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.280
Now that you mention it...

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.050
He's probably gone off to flirt
with some pichi-pichi gal!

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.220
He's not like a certain dirty
old man I could mention.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.720
If not a pichi-pichi gal,
perhaps it's some older woman.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.060
Yoink!

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.250
Huh? They're all gone...

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.580
Huh? Ah, here's one, here's one...

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.600
Um, Big Brother,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.760
we'll just leave this meat here for you.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.770
U- Um, Mama's seasoning is pretty good.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.550
Well, we're going home now.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.710
I'll be back tomorrow, okay?

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.880
Hey, what are you doing?!
Hurry and get going!

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.710
What was that?

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.050
What the...?

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.740
This is awful!

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.920
It's the Saiyamen!
The Great Saiyamen have come!

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.410
All right, let's let them take care of this.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.580
What is that thing?!

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.200
What is that thing?!

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.380
What is that?!

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.550
A ghost with legs? No, it's
a monster with just legs!

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.550
This could be the enormous evil
that the old man was talking about.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.890
That has to be it!
Gohan-kun, let's do our usual!

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.560
Eh? You want to do that?!

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.050
Isn't it obvious?

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.570
As long as the Great Saiyamen are here,
evil shall not prosper in our world!

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.740
Great Saiyaman Mark I...

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.070
...and Mark II...

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.740
...as you expected...

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.250
Hear us out until we've finished!

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.930
Damn it...!

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:02.360
Wreck the city, will you?!
You'll pay for this!

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.530
Here goes!

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.040
What kind of beast is this?!

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.880
All right...!

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.710
Huh?

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.240
Gohan-kun, let him have it!

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.910
I get it! He becomes solid
momentarily when he attacks!

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.070
All right...!

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.710
You got him!

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.720
No, not yet.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.050
That melody...

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.230
The monster disappeared!

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.510
Tapion...

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.360
Gohan-kun, over there!

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.560
B- Big Brother, if you want, you can use this.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.050
Don't come near me!

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.570
Don't get mad, I'm leaving.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.240
Oh, you didn't eat?

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.570
Get lost!

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.060
R- Right!

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.760
Oh, no!

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.610
W- What?! What happened?!

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.610
Thank goodness! You're safe!

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.230
I know.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.900
I'll leave your breakfast here, okay?

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.390
Bye. I'll bring you more later.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.910
Apparently, Trunks-kun has
been sneaking food to him.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.580
Oh, yeah? That's nice of Trunks-kun to do.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.250
He's always talking about how jealous he is
of Goten-kun for having an older brother,

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.920
so maybe he feels like he's
got his own big brother now.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.090
I know how Trunks-kun feels.
I'm an only child, too, after all.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.260
But you've been so keyed up lately.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.420
It's Trunks-kun's power that is keyed up!

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.620
No! No!

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.280
That's Big Brother's! You can't eat it!

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.620
Aw, geez...

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.220
Okay, Big Brother, I'll leave
tonight's stuff here, okay?

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.230
That flute sounds nice.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.720
Play it some more.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.390
Then again, never mind.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.580
Boy, give me the flute!

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.930
Trunks, the flute!

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.270
- R- Right!
- Wait boy!

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:51.760
Tapion is no hero! He is the very
monster that ran wild through the city!

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.280
Trunks, don't let him fool you.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.280
If you give him the flute, then the whole earth,

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.550
to say nothing of the universe,
will be completely destroyed!

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:05.220
Now, hand it over to me.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.050
Trunks, trust me.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.720
Come on...

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:31.070
That's it, hurry and give me the flute.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.070
Big Brother!

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:40.740
W- What?!

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.090
Big Brother!

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.600
I know... I'm going...

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.100
I sure am hungry.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.030
Would you eat with me?

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.550
This is really delicious! Try some!

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:17.560
Trunks brought his big brother
over to spend the night.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.900
Isn't that amazing? I mean,
becoming friends with a hero...

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.060
He is absolutely delighted.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.570
See? See? See? This is awesome!

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:36.240
They bought it for me for
my birthday last year. Look!

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:43.920
Well? Isn't this fun? And look,
when you do this here, it does this!

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.920
Say, Big Brother, you try it.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.910
And actually, after that, you know what?

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.930
Say, Big Brother, do you have any brothers?

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.270
Yeah, one younger brother.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.370
Wow, that's great! What kind of boy is he?

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.540
He was a kind boy, like you, Trunks.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.880
Say, tell me about your planet, Big Brother.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.540
Sure.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:16.220
My home is a place called Planet Conuts,
in the Southern Galaxy.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:22.220
It was a beautiful planet, which, like Earth
here, was blessed with greenery and water.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:27.900
But then, one day, there was a
warlock who raised this phantasm...

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.230
...named Hildegarn, which attacked us.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:37.070
People were killed, and cities
were demolished and destroyed.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.580
Just as everyone had
resigned themselves to die,

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.410
a miracle happened.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.540
Minoshia...

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.370
you've been killed, huh?

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.540
Take care, Trunks.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:34.880
Where are you going?

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.900
If you'd like, you're welcome
to stay with us from now on.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.230
Please, feel free.
Trunks would be thrilled, after all.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.240
I can't do that.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.730
Why not?

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:56.250
There is a phantasm
locked away inside my body.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.590
Huh? A phantasm?

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:02.680
I'm afraid I don't know what you're
talking about. Explain it to me.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.530
What is this "phantasm"?

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.200
Right...

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.360
There was a sect of warlocks
that drifted in from somewhere...

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:22.540
They took the spirit body of the totem that had
absorbed all of the evil will on Planet Conuts,

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.540
infused it with wicked energy,

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:30.710
and transformed it into
the phantasm Hildegarn.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.570
Those warlocks must have had
incredible demonic powers, huh?

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:52.910
Yes. Hoi was one of their order.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.240
Then we were all completely
taken in by that old man.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.910
But why is the phantasm within your body?

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:05.850
It's because there was a legendary sword
and flute that could control the totem.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.860
By any chance, do you mean those?

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.350
Yes.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.690
These items were given to us by God.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.530
While we suppressed the
phantasm's power with the flute,

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:25.210
a priest who was in the service of
God split the phantasm's body...

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.700
...into an upper half and a lower half.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:58.570
And then, Hildegarn's upper
half was locked inside my body,

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.900
and the lower half was locked
inside my brother's body.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.410
Peace returned to Planet Conuts.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:15.260
As a result, my brother
and I were hailed as heroes.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.930
But you were inside that music box, right?

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:26.930
The warlocks tried to retake the phantasm,
and began coming after us. And so...

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.940
...to lock away the phantasm forever,

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:35.100
we had ourselves sealed up
inside those music boxes.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.620
However, with the two of us near each other,

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:47.620
the upper half and the lower half
resonated with each other, trying to reunite.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.290
In order to keep the phantasm
from ever being revived,

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:54.630
the two of us were each sent away
in pods to different galaxies.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:58.970
However, Hoi wants to make
the whole universe his own,

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.900
so he located both of our music boxes.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.240
Where is your brother?

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.240
He has probably been killed already.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.240
We can't let Hoi get away with this.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.910
As long as I keep his upper half locked away,

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.920
Hildegarn cannot be
revived in his complete form.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.920
You mean, you haven't slept in all
these days since you were released?

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.920
N- No.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.260
All right, let me take care of this.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.590
All I have to do is make
something like that music box,

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.930
to keep that power under control, right?

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.600
C- Can you do that?

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:35.270
I haven't thrown out the broken
music box yet, so I think I can.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.940
Please make it, I beg you!

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.940
You got it. Hang in there until then, okay?

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.100
Yes.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.100
There you go!

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.110
It's all done!

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.960
Tapion's bedroom!

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.120
Really?!

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:06.900
Inside here should be just like the
music box. Go on inside and see.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.730
You can go in there and sleep
without having to worry.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.730
Thank you very much!

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:43.100
Once Hildegarn is reunited,
this will be nothing!

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.210
I will hold the whole universe
in my hand, starting with Earth!

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.720
What?!

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:29.240
Is that right? So that's
what the story is, huh?

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:39.930
Big Brother!

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:40.930
What happened to you?

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:43.260
Where's Hildegarn?

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.930
I somehow managed to lock
his upper half inside my body,

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.940
but his lower half is running loose in the city!

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.940
What?!

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.610
The power attracting his upper half and
lower half together has gotten stronger,

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:58.280
and there's nothing more that I can do!

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.950
Big Brother!

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.220
I can make something even sturdier!

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.880
It's too late now!

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:10.380
N- Now, while you still can, please, you
have to kill me, and Hildegarn with me!

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.050
Big Brother!

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:22.570
- Now! Hurry!
- I won't let you do that!

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.590
Trunks!

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.260
Big Brother, play it!

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.750
All right!

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.090
Big Brother!

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.580
His body...!

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:40.910
It's reunited!

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.920
After a millennium's worth of time,

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.260
the phantasm Hildegarn has
now been completely revived!

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:56.420
Now, suck dry as much energy
from the Earthlings as you like!

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.090
Damn it!

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.050
Big Brother!

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:30.560
That thing won't do you any more good!

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.900
Impossible!

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:36.890
Behold, the power of the
completely restored Hildegarn!

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.570
You'll have to face me!

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.070
Huh?

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.070
Father!

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.260
Leave it to us from here on, okay?

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.930
Big Brother, don't you move from here.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:00.920
Trunks!

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:08.200
We ain't letting you have your way!

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.370
His power and speed have
risen to a whole new level!

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.050
Father!

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.730
I can't get a bead on his solid form!

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:01.190
Smash up another man's house, will you?!

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:03.860
I am in a foul mood today!

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:08.020
Don't come too close, or you'll get burned!

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.720
Dammit!

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.510
I was too easy... on him...

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:07.020
Vegeta!

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.010
- Papa!
- Father!

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.860
Goten, Fusion!

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:24.870
All right...!

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:27.540
Fu... sion!

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.030
Ha!

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.040
Yay! Super Saiyan 3, right out of the gate!

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:47.730
Yo, yo, monster! You're finished now!

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:51.890
Gotenks-sama is going to send
you off to Yama-sama's place!

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:09.080
Now! Continuous Die-Die Missiles!

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:30.940
Hmm? Finished already?
Aw, that was disappointing.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.270
What are you doing?!
Hurry and finish him off!

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:35.610
Okay, okay...

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.730
l- It can't be...!

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.730
You're kidding!

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:24.420
Goten! Trunks!

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:29.920
Gohan-kun!

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.110
Videl-san...

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:04.230
What incredible power!
He really is a monster!

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.720
Dammit!

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.730
Oh, crap!

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:37.750
All of our attacks are going right though him!

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:51.940
Damn... No matter how much power we have...

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.610
...it's no use against him...

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:04.560
Destroy the entire universe!

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.890
It will all become power for you, Hildegarn!

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.080
If this is a bad dream, then wake up...

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:32.740
Big Brother...!

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.760
You fool! You think that thing
is going to work at this point?!

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.100
What?!

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:08.550
A hero...

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:11.550
Big Brother is a hero, all right!

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:15.890
I cannot allow this planet to get
caught in the middle of this, too.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:24.730
How much longer will you feed on the suffering
of others like this, until you've had enough?

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.060
Impossible!

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.590
You did it!

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.460
You did it, Big Brother!

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.930
Trunks...

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:52.760
Kill me, and Hildegarn with me!

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:55.600
You have to protect Earth!

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.940
I- I can't do that!

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.430
Kill me! You want to be
a hero too, don't you?!

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.540
I- I can't!

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:08.550
Trunks, if this keeps up,
Earth will be destroyed.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:12.890
Please, let me die as a hero!

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:16.890
If he is revived one more time,
there will be no stopping him.

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.380
Please!

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:37.740
Thank you. I'm glad to have met you.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:47.750
S- Stop!

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.590
Big Brother!

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:15.370
Fool! You do not have the power to
contain Hildegarn in his complete form!

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.560
Get them!

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:57.750
There ain't no way you're
going to get away with this!

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:21.210
Trunks, stay out of this!
I'm going to defeat him!

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:25.220
Father! His weakness is...!

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.550
I know!

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:32.050
I can only beat him during the instant
he becomes solid as he attacks!

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.060
That won't work.

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:43.400
This sort of punch won't work!
Fight like you mean it!

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:50.070
Hey, what's the matter?
Come and get me!

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.240
If I don't do it...

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:08.520
If I don't do it...

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.020
...who will?!

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.030
Ryu-ken!

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:00.570
You did it!

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:16.860
It's my fault that so many
people were made to die.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:21.030
If only I had been able to
fully control Hildegarn...

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:28.870
Don't worry. We'll ask Shen Long to
bring those who were killed back to life.

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:33.550
There. Now you should be able to go
back a thousand years, to your time.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.550
T- Thanks.

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:39.540
Aww, and here I had
finally gotten a Big Brother.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.220
As long as we have the time
machine, you can see him again.

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:43.890
Oh, that's right!

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.050
Trunks!

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.890
You're giving it to me?

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:53.570
Yeah. I don't need it anymore, after all.

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:56.900
- All right! Yay! Yay!
- How nice!

00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.390
Okay then, everyone, take care!

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:17.920
This blue world

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:28.090
now shines, embraced in love.

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:33.940
I wouldn't lie to you!

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:44.280
I won't stand by and let anyone
destroy the earth, where dreams dance!

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:49.450
With a bang-up passion, Dragonball!

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:55.630
When I throw a punch,

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:58.960
he disappears like smoke.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:04.900
My foe this time has me bowled over.

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.910
(Go!) Don't let your guard down!

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:10.910
(Jump!) Gohan and Videl!

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:14.250
(Go!) Even if your friends...

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:17.250
(Kick!)...get taken down,

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:25.590
in the end, if I don't do it, who will?!

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:28.260
I wouldn't lie to you!

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.930
I'm through playing around!

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:34.600
I'm going to show you

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:38.600
my Super Saiyan power!

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:44.100
With a knock-down-drag-out fight, Dragonball!
